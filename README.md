The [Caliper Analytics® Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1) 
provides a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data at 
scale. Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API™) for marshalling 
and transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, 
analysis and use.  

*caliper-central* is a clearinghouse for cross-cutting issues that may impact the various Caliper 
repositories maintained in Github.  We use a [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) board to organize, 
track and report on our issues and current work.  ZenHub provides browser 
[extensions](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) for both Chrome and Firefox. 
A web/mobile [interface](https://app.zenhub.com/) is also available.

## Contributing
We welcome the posting of issues by non IMS Global Learning Consortium members (e.g., feature 
requests, bug reports, questions, etc.) but we *do not* accept contributions in the form of pull 
requests from non-members. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more 
information.
